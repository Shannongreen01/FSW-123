Movie Search

I decided to do my project as a movie search. I used the API Open Movie Database to make this search work.
When completing the movie search it will display a pic for the movie's tied to what the user searches for.
I also added an option to "star" your favorite movie. The app does this by taking the ID from the API and then stores it into 
a local storage.
